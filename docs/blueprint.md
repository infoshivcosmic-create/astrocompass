# **App Name**: Vastu Compass Pro

## Core Features:

- Interactive Compass: Display a rotating compass with all 16 Vastu directions.
- Real-time Heading: Show real-time degree display of the current heading.
- Location Display: Display the device's current latitude and longitude.
- Vastu Details: Provide detailed Vastu information for each direction (ruling deity, meaning, benefits).
- Logo Placement: Add a logo in the top-left corner.
- Calibration Tool: Calibration function using device sensors. A calibration button lets the user recalibrate if readings are off. Visual alerts such as error message and icon alerts the user that a recalibration might be needed.
- AI-Augmented Guidance: Augment Vastu information based on a language model's tool by having the AI consult Vastu texts (provided to the tool as context) about which recommendations might best suit the heading the user is currently facing.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light teal (#70D6FF), inspired by the element of water in Vastu, symbolizing flow and adaptability.
- Background color: Very light teal (#E0F7FA), a desaturated version of the primary, creates a calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#A0E9FF), an analogous color to the primary, adds a touch of brightness and enhances key elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, provides a modern and readable experience.
- Use simple, line-style icons for location, calibration, and settings.
- The compass should be centered on the screen, with the degree display directly below. Vastu information will appear in a scrollable section under the degree.
- Subtle animations for compass rotation and directional updates to enhance user experience.
